# PARALLAX
A parallax website is a type of web design that creates an engaging and immersive visual experience for users as they scroll down the page.  As users scroll, the background appears to move more slowly, providing a dynamic and interactive feel. 

This technique is often used to showcase products, tell a story, or enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of a website. Parallax websites are known for their captivating visual effects and are popular in modern web design.
